I started my programming adventure with C and C++ and have been continuing with C# and Python in recent years. I can also use HTML, PHP and MySQL. In addition, I can use MS Excel with VBA and have intermediate knowledge of Adobe Photoshop.

I have a B2 level command of English. Over time, I have focused on 2D game production with Unity as a hobby.

I am eager to gain new experiences in a dynamic and innovative company environment.
