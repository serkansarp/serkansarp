- 👋 Hi, I’m @serkansarp. Self-taught software developer.
- 👀 I've finished learning C++/object-oriented programming skills but enhancing myself on algorithmic logic and C# .NET Framework.
- 🌱  Most of my C++/OOP practices can be seen on my <a href="https://gist.github.com/serkansarp" target=_blank>gists</a> and I'm collecting my C# practices into one project repository: <a href=https://github.com/serkansarp/C-Sharp-Pratiklerim>My C# Practices</a> which is growing fast.
- 💞️ I am enthusiastic about pursuing a software developer position within a dynamic software development company. I can work at office, hybrid or remote in Ankara/Turkey, remote-first hybrid for others to work and enchance myself faster.
- 📫 You can reach me via my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/serkansarp" target=_blank>Linkedin profile</a>.
